# Personalized Recommendation with Transformers
This repository contains a guide and the associated code to build a personalized movie recommendation system using the Transformer model. Using the MovieLens dataset, we explore how to preprocess data, define our model, and generate recommendations based on user interactions.

## Contents
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The MovieLens dataset is loaded and preprocessed. We construct vocabularies for movie ids and user ids, and create sequences of user interactions. This process converts the data into a format suitable for our recommendation model. This includes the following sub-steps:

    1.1 **Loading Dataset**
   
    1.2 **Creating Vocabulary**
   
    1.3 **Generating Sequences**
   
    1.4 **Train Test Split**
2. **Model Definition**: We define and initialize our Transformer model, which will be trained using our preprocessed dataset. The steps include:

    2.1 Positional Encoder: A positional encoder is defined for the Transformer, embedding order information required by the model.
   
    2.2 Transformer Model: The transformer model, taking both user id and movie id sequences as input, is defined and initialized. The model generates movie recommendations.
   
3. **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using our dataset, after which we evaluate its performance on unseen data. We also generate popular movie recommendations as a baseline to compare the success of our model. At the end, we compare our results with a normalized discounted gain (NDCG) metric, revealing that our model outperforms the baseline.

4. **Conclusion**: This repository provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a personalized movie recommendation system using Transformer models, highlighting their potential use in diverse contexts beyond natural language processing.
